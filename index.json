The major motivation of this post is to collect a few useful tips to maintain a good health status.\nKeep in mind that all infrastructures should aim for fitting the people, but not the other way around. Monitors: a good setup of monitors can help to reduce the risks of neck injury or even cervical spondylosis.\n Dual monitors: 1 horizontal (browsing)+ 1 vertical (coding) Positioning: One arm distance (45–70 cm) / Good height which neck should be straight, relaxed with neutral posture (e.g. extra height with A4 paper bundles) / touched edge of two monitors aligned with nose, it has semi-circle angle NO sedentary: stand up for a break every 20 minutes, relax the eye muscles by focusing on somewhere far away with green space Addicted to whiteboard: sketching ideas, equation-related stuffs should happen on whiteboard as much as possible, good for your neck and health in general Use reading holders: keep your vertebral and neck straight up during reading, not downward. Thick textbook: disassemble into chapters and rebind them on the leftmost column for two bindings, like a small leaflet. Use ergonomic keyboard: open elbow with 90 deg /forearms on the table / shoulder relaxed Use ergonomic chair: curvature to support back / relax shoulder / place hips as close to the back of the chair as possible / adjust height for relaxed feet and legs  ","date":1590366421,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590410758,"objectID":"4a90e92512e7284d585b36f9b5aa881f","permalink":"https://zuoxingdong.github.io/post/ergonomic-desk-and-chair/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T02:27:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/ergonomic-desk-and-chair/","section":"post","summary":"We all know that a healthy lifestyle could enable us to work much more efficiently and keep being creative.

The Prisoner's Dilemma, which is a canonical game, is often used to present the rationality. In real experiment in cognitive psychology which were performed by Shafir and Tversky (Shafir and Tversky, 1992a, 1992b), the statistical data show the existence of the irrational behaviors in reality. The phenomenon is called disjunction effect. To explain why it probably happens, we review the Asano-Khrennikov-Ohya model (Asano et al., 2011c; Khrennikov, 2011b) which is the mathematical modeling of the process of decision making in the game of Prisoner's Dilemma. It applies only the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics to the decision making process rather than the quantum physical model. In this paper, we present several numerical simulations for the Asano-Khrennikov-Ohya model together with the graphs of the von Neumann entropy for the solutions. By analyzing the simulation results, we explicitly and numerically present the existence of the irrational behavior for the player which is generated by the Asano-Khrennikov-Ohya model.","tags":["quantum mechanics","quantum cognition"],"title":"Numerical Simulation of Asano-Khrennikov-Ohya Quantum-like Decision Making Model.","type":"publication"}]
